Movement simulator for maritime platforms

# Technology

This repo will contain a JS library that simulates the movement of a maritime platform.

The JS code will be written in TypeScript.

An UI will be provided that allows review of the simuation performance.

# Simulation

These aspects will be simulated:
- motion of a surface platform, as it responds to demanded course and speed.
- motion of a dived platform, adding demanded depth to the above
- impacts of wind and current on the platforms
